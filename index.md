<p>
Hello you. welcome to my personal web page. I'm Anudeep Chirumalla from the east coast of India. I am a CS Grad and a technology generalist interested in product innovation, high-performance systems, internet companies, and all sorts of technology. I have the ability to deep dive into tech and go wide in business applications as needed. I believe in an all-hands-on-deck attitude, which is the fastest way to learn and grow.
</p>

<p>
I used to work for HCL Tech as a senior engineer looking after a top US telecom operator by facilitating their change management and business transformation projects. Before that, I have worked for multiple large MNCs. and before that, I sojourned to France to do my MBA. 

</p>



<p>
Currently, I am looking for opportunities in cloud engineering and global IT delivery space.
