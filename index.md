Hello you. welcome to my personal web page. I'm Anudeep Chirumalla from the east coast of India. I am a CS Grad and a technology generalist interested in product innovation, high-performance systems, internet companies, and all sorts of technology.

<p>
I used to work for HCL Tech as a senior engineer looking after a top US telecom operator by facilitating their change management and business transformation projects. Before that I have worked for multiple large MNCs. and before that I sejourned to france to do my MBA. I have the ability to deep dive into tech and go wide in business applications as needed. I believe in an all-hands-on-deck attitude, which is the fastest way to learn and grow.

Currently, I am in a mission to build my company in global IT delivery and cloud expertise space.
